Repeatable commands can be called again by repeatedly hitting the last key stroke.
An example should make this clear: you can call kmacro-end-and-call-macro (bound to `C-x e') repeatedly -- the first
time with `C-x e' and with only `e' subsequently. After you press another
key, things are back to normal.

The following packages can be used to make other commands repeatable:

* http://furius.ca/pubcode/pub/conf/lib/elisp/blais/repeatable.el - `defadvice'-based implementation
* https://github.com/leoliu/repeatable.el - An `fset'+`set-transient-map'-based implementation, for emacs 24+
* [[Hydra]] also allows repetition over groups of commands, among other features.
