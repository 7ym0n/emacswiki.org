Here are some bots (alphabetically) that use ErBot | who runs them | the wikis they usu. keep track of | and the channels they hang out on:

|| <b>name</b>|| <b>owner</b> || <b>purpose or corresponding wiki</b> || <b>IRC channels they hang out on</b> ||
|| fsbot || [[deego]] || Emacs Wiki, Community wiki || #emacs, #fsedu, #dunnet, #gnu, etc. ||
|| donald-bot || [[kaste]] ||  || #latex ||



I would be interested in knowing any uses of ErBot.  Please add your
notes, experiences, anything :) to this page or to the list above.

More info on bots: 


* fsbot runs in the "maximum-info" mode---it almost always tries to
provide information no matter what you say to it, and hangs out on
channels like #emacs, #gnu, etc.
