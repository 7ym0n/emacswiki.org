Emacs jargon predates most user interfaces used today.
See EmacsJargon for an introductory translation to/from Emacs-speak.
See EmacsSymbolNotation for the ways Emacs and EmacsLisp types are presented.

* '''[::macro 日本語]''' -- An EmacsLisp form that, when evaluated, translates a [[sexp]] that is a [[list]] into another such, which is then evaluated and its result is returned.  IOW, it rewrites (without evaluating) one sexp as another and then evaluates the latter.  It is typically defined using `defmacro'.  It can be expanded without evaluating the result, using `macroexpand'.  See Manual:macros.

* [[narrowing]]  -- limiting [[buffer]] scope temporarily
* '''[::obarray 日本語]''' -- a [[symbol]] table implemented as a special kind of vector.  Think of it as a hash table for looking up symbols.  The value of [[variable]] `obarray' is the obarray used by default by `intern' and `read'. See [[Manual:Creating Symbols]].
* [[overlay]] -- a [[property list]] that is similar to a [[text property]] list, but which is associated with [[buffer]] positions, not with characters. Typically used to highlight text.
* '''[::page 日本語]''' -- A block of text delimited by [[form feed]] (aka [[page break]]) characters  or the beginning or end of the [[buffer]].  See Manual:Pages
* '''[::plist 日本語]''' (aka '''[::property list 日本語]''') -- A list with an even number of elements that are treated alternately as keys and their values. Both keys and values can be any Lisp objects. A plist can be part of a [[symbol]] or disembodied (independent of any symbol).

* '''[::search ring 日本語]''' -- [[ring]] of previously used search strings; the value of [[variable]] `search-ring' (see also [[regexp search ring]])
