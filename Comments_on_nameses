I've made most of the modifications today, so I haven't tested everything for a long time. Please share your thoughts about how to improve this code :)!

You should move the code to the Elisp area. Then change this page to a description of the library. Or remove this page altogether if you do not want a description page. To remove it, replace the text by just "DeletedPage".

All right, I'll try to make this more descriptive tomorrow, with a link to the code.

It looks like the current implementation fails to release the current named session's lock upon kill-emacs. Once Emacs has been killed, re-opening it and attempting to reload the session warns that the lock still exists, prompting for a confirmation.

This does not break functionality (the session does save correctly during the kill-emacs routine), but it might be worth looking into at some point down the road.
