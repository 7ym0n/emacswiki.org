I use Emacs.

Started using emacs in 1988. Stopped using emacs in 1988. Started and stopped on and off over the years, then got serious about 2005. Still a beginner, then. :-) Beginning to move toward "living in emacs".

* [[Themes]] as a [EmacsWiki:id=CustomizeByPlatform workaround] for host- and OS-specific customization

== Probably never going to learn/master/enable: ==

* LaTeX

== Extensions etc that I've contributed to: ==

All trivial one- or two-line mods (so far). You've got to start somewhere...

* [[DVC]]
* [[ratpoison]] (bundled elisp files)
* [[slurp.el]]

== Plan ==

I'm gradually perfecting a multi-site-aware framework for init.el. You can (but don't have to) write host-, OS- and emacs-release-specific elisp files, and you can conditionally compile host-, OS-, and emacs-release-specific blocks of code within other files.

I have a few bits of elisp and emacs-driving shell script that I think may be useful to the community. I'll be putting them up Real Soon Now.
