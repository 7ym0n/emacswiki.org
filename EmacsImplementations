It is a pretty long page, though.

This document, by  CraigFinseth, provides a partial -- and not
comprehensive -- list of implementations of Emacs-type editors and
literature about such editors. You can help make it more comprehensive
by sending the author additional information and/or updates.

This document is also gradually acquiring the role of a repository of
(at least) Emacs-related history. While that subject requires a book
to itself, this document will probably serve until someone (<i>not</i>
the author!) writes one.
