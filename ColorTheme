This page collects reviews and recommendations of the various colour themes out there.

These are all [[CustomThemes|custom themes]].

Note that in the old days, there used to be a separate `color-theme' package that installed color themes by modifying Emacs faces directly instead of using the /custom theme/ framework. You can find it on the [[ColorThemes|Color Themes]] page.
See [[CustomThemes#ComparedToColorThemes|comparing color theme and custom theme]] for a comparison of the two.
