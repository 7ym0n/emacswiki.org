A '''[::color theme]''' is a package that sets a ton of [[Face|faces]] and variables for you. 
This page collects reviews and recommendations of the various colour themes out there.

These are all implemented using [[CustomThemes|custom themes]].

(In the old days, there used to be a separate [[ColorThemes|color-theme.el]] package that installed color themes by modifying Emacs faces directly instead of using the /custom theme/ framework. It hasn't been updated since 2009 and these days, using /custom theme/ is the popular choice. See [[CustomThemes#ComparedToColorThemes|comparing color theme and custom theme]] for a comparison of the two.)
