This is a minimalistic colour theme. That is, it tries to minimize the use of colours and prefers to use size difference and font-weight to highlight the few things it wants to highlight. I guess it's somewhat inspired by Rob Pike's idea to not have any syntax highlighting at all.

== Switching between Brutalist and Brutalist Dark ==

This code switches between the two themes based on whether the sun is up or not.

{{{
;; load both themes
(load-theme 'brutalist t t)
(load-theme 'brutalist-dark t t)

;; enable the appropriate one
(require 'calendar)
(setq calendar-latitude [47 22 north]
      calendar-longitude [8 33 east])
(let* ((date (calendar-current-date))
       (data (solar-sunrise-sunset date))
       (sunrise (car (car data)))
       (sunset (car (cadr data)))
       (time (decode-time))
       (now (+ (nth 2 time) (/ (nth 1 time) 60.0))))
  (if (and (< sunrise now) (< now sunset))
      (enable-theme 'brutalist)
    (enable-theme 'brutalist-dark)))
}}}

== Changes for rcirc ==
