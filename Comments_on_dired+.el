@yPhil: Please try the latest - should be OK now. They changed all of the Emacs-Wiki URLS, and I haven't gotten around to changing them in all of my libraries.

I think The `Symbolâ€™s value as variable is void: dired-omit-files` error mentioned in the link above is because `dired+' is referencing `dired-omit-files' in an `;;;###autoload' statement (the default value for `diredp-omit-files-regexp').  There shouldn't be any need to autoload `defcustom`s, as far as I know.

[[npostavs]]: Thanks for the heads-up. I updated dired+.el to fix it differently. (I disagree that defcustoms should never be autoloaded.)

DrewAdams: I can't see how your change will help, the reference to `dired-omit-files' in an autoloaded `defucstom' remains.  Expressions (or `defcustom' default values) which are `;;;###autoload'ed get evaluated before the file itself is loaded.  (I won't go as far as saying defcustoms should *never* be autoloaded, but in this case I can't see any justification for it.)
