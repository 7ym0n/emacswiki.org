There is a 404 error when you click on the link/button "[Dired+ Help on the Web]" in the dired+ mode (C-h m) help page.

@yPhil: Please try the latest - should be OK now. They changed all of the Emacs-Wiki URLS, and I haven't gotten around to changing them in all of my libraries.

I think The `Symbolâ€™s value as variable is void: dired-omit-files` error mentioned in the link above is because `dired+' is referencing `dired-omit-files' in an `;;;###autoload' statement (the default value for `diredp-omit-files-regexp').  There shouldn't be any need to autoload `defcustom`s, as far as I know.
