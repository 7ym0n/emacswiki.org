Moving around in text is done with:
* '''`C-<Left>, '''`C-<Right>'''' - Move left or right by one word
* '''`C-a'''', '''`C-e'''' - Beginning of line, end of line
* '''`C-s'''', '''`C-r'''' - Incremental search; while searching both '''`C-s'''' and '''`C-r'''' are available. After exiting, '''`C-x C-x'''' will move the cursor back to where you started the search.

'''`C-g'''' is your 'panic' command, it can be used anywhere. It will cancel any other command, incomplete keybinding, or running function. It will exit the minibar if it has focus.

Instead of keybindings, you can also run commands by name; type '''`M-x'''' followed by the name of the command. Note that while it is named '''`M-x'''', it is much easier to type as '''`ESC x''''.

Many commands are best learned by their name rather than their keybinding. The most useful ones to learn are:
* describe-key - find the name of any command bound to a keybinding you know
* describe-function - learn more about a command
* describe-variable - learn more about variables and their values; change their value permanently with customize-variable
* describe-mode - learn more about the mode you are in (e.g. python-mode) and its keybindings

Handling windows and pop-ups:

* '''`q'''' - Most temporary windows that have focus can be closed by typing '''`q''''.
* '''`C-x 0'''' - If a window cannot be closed by '''`q'''', it can be closed by '''`C-x 0''''
* '''`C-x 1'''' - If the window you want to close does not have focus, you can use '''`C-x 1'''' to close all other windows
* '''`ESC ESC ESC'''' - Similar to '''`C-x 1'''', but closes all other frames too
