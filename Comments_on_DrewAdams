Hello Drew,
Since you are the author of dired+, I have a feature request: to support relative symlinks in Diredp-move-files.
Currently the symlinks will be broken after the move.

@godblessfq: I don't know just what the request is for such rel symlink support. (Also, I can't test symlink code, as I'm on MS Windows. If you have a patch or more precise info, please suggest it. Thx.
