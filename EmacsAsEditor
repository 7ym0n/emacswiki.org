Emacs can act as an editor for other applications.

= Use EmacsClient =

In order to connect from other applications to the same Emacs instance use EmacsClient.

= How to keep file metadata =

One problem when using Emacs to edit files which "belong" to other applications can be that file metadata the operating system/file system stores along the fele content are not preserved on saving the file in Emacs.

=== Solution for macOS ===

In macOS  Finder tags are in danger of being lost when editing a file with Emacs.

But if in Emacs the variable `backup-by-copying` is set to `t`  Emacs will create backups by /copying/ (instead of renaming) and therefore write the new content to the same file (i.e. inode) as before. This will keep the Finder tags intact.

/Very/ helpful for document management systems like [https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink DEVONthink]  which rely on Finder tags.
