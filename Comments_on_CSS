Is there any reason why HTTPS urls for CSS files wouldn't work?

This:

https://raw.github.com/nicferrier/nics-emacswiki-css/master/nicferrier.css

does not work when used in a CSS enabler:

http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=browse;id=CSS;css=https://raw.github.com/nicferrier/nics-emacswiki-css/master/nicferrier.css

You need to host it on a wiki page (or I need to upload it to Emacs Wiki because our HTTPS setup is such that style sheets need to come from the same host).

Try it with NicFerrierCss: 
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_CSS?css=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emacswiki.org%2Femacs%3Faction%3Dbrowse%3Bid%3DNicFerrierCss%3Braw%3D1%3Bmime-type%3Dtext%2Fcss

Return:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_CSS?css=

I think Cali+ CSS is missing

Hm, the link [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;id=CSS;css=/css/cali.css;theme= Designed in California] seems to work for me. What's the link you're using and what's the effect you're getting?
