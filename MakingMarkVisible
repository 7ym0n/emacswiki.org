Put the following in your .emacs to [::MakeMarkVisible] at all times.

Interesting alternative to `C-x C-x' (`exchange-point-and-mark') to see the mark.

Might be even more interesting to show ''all'' of the marks (or the N most recent) on the mark ring, not just the (current) mark - perhaps in rainbow colors from recent (red) to old (blue).

And, instead of seeing marks all the time, I'd like to have a binding that shows marks only temporarily - e.g. until some easy event, like a mouse-button release (that is, display marks only while pressed).

BTW, when the mark is at the end of a line, the buffer is highlighted from the line end to the right window edge -- looks like a minor bug. -- DrewAdams

See also VisibleMark for such sort of things.

I wrote some elisp that displays the points in the mark ring.  It's modeled after Occur.  The line number for each point in the mark-ring is displayed as well as the contents of that line.  Pressing RET on the line will take you to the point from the mark-ring.  The function is called 'show-marks' and is available at http://therowes.net/~greg/code/emacs/emacs.d/mark.el
