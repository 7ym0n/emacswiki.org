The [http://xelf.me/scheme-mosaic.html Mosaic] project builds on
[https://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ Ecasound] and
[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/snd.html Snd]
to implement a concatenative synthesis system and music sequencer with a spreadsheet-based UI.
The UI is based on [http://xelf.me/cell.html Cell-mode].
