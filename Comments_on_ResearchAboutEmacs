What is an academic publication ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Let's say it needs to be a text, published maybe in a journal or in proceedings. Obviously it needs to be a PDF because that's how you can tell academic text from other kinds ;)

I started by using APA 6th edition but that's just because that's what I am used to. We can agree on another style, let's just keep it consistent :)
