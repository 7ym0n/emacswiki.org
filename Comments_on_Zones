I think this is a really useful package to have in emacs, so many thanks for writing it, however I keep getting this message in a *Compile-log* buffer when starting Emacs 26.1....

Warning (bytecomp): ‘interactive-p’ is an obsolete function (as of 23.2); use ‘called-interactively-p’ instead. [6 times]

Using Zones.el

Version: 2019.4.30
Package-Requires: ()
Last-Updated: Tue Apr 30 17:07:29 2019 (-0700)

Is there any way I can stop this happening? thanks

Please ignore all such warnings, which are benign.  They come from the library being compatible also with older Emacs versions.

But if you see a warning you are not sure about please feel free to let me know (as you've just done), and I'll check.  Thx - Drew

Thanks, but is there anyway to stop the Compile Log from popping up all the time when Emacs starts?
