The last method used by [[SetAutoMode]] in the automatic selection of a major mode. It does the same as [[magic-mode-alist]], which see, but has lower precedence than [[auto-mode-alist]], which is probably often a good idea for the reasons explained on [[magic-mode-alist]].

If you want to move any items already in ##magic-mode-alist## to this lower-precedence alist, you can do so with the following code:

[code]

;; Assume that magic-mode-alist should still have 
;; higher precedence than the items in the fallback list:

(setq magic-fallback-mode-alist (append 
                                 magic-mode-alist 
                                 magic-fallback-mode-alist)
      magic-mode-alist          nil)

[/code]
