'''JED''' is a text editor that can emulate Emacs to some extent. It makes extensive use of the S-Lang library. It is highly cross-platform compatible; JED runs on Microsoft Windows and all flavors on Linux and Unix. Older versions are available for DOS. It is also very lightweight (meaning very parsimonious in its use of system resources), which makes it an ideal editor for older systems, embedded systems, etc.
