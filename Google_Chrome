Google Chrome and Google Chromium are WebKit based browsers with a souped up JavaScript engine for running complex web-apps.

== Integrating with Emacs ==

You can use Emacs to edit textareas in the manner of It's All Text using the [[Edit with Emacs]] Chrom(ium) extension. It comes with its own elisp based "Edit Server" to respond to edit requests from Chrome without needing to use emacsclient.
