Koutline mode (##kotl-mode.el##) by BobWeiner is a major mode for editing koutlines and associated commands.  It is part of [[Hyperbole|GNU Hyperbole]].

This has some neat features that I have not seen elsewhere such as auto-numbering.  It has been around many years. (AllOut also does auto-numbering but likely only single level numbering, not multi-level as in legal outlines, nor does it have permanent hyperlinkable ids for each node),
