Gmane provides an NNTP gateway to many Free Software-related mailing lists.  It's especially useful to read and post to mailing lists in [[Gnus]] as newsgroups, rather than having to subscribe to them as mailing lists.  It was created and is administrated by LarsMagneIngebrigtsen.

== Using in Gnus ==

Set `gnus-select-method' to ##news.gmane.io##.

== Emacs-related hierarchies ==

* gmane.emacs -- many groups for emacs and his applications
* gmane.mail.wanderlust
* gmane.mail.mew

== News ==
