Bazaar (aka <code>bzr</code>) is a distributed version control system much like [[Git]], [[Mercurial]]
and DaRcs.

Bazaar is available from http://bazaar-vcs.org.

== Modes ==

* [[VC]] -- supports Bazaar through the vc-bzr.el backend. Is distributed with Emacs since version 22.2. You can also get it [http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/vc-bzr.el here].
* [[DVC]] -- supports Bazaar.
* Lisp:bazaar.el -- A user interface specific to Bazaar.

== Emacs no longer uses Bazaar ==

In the past, Emacs used Bazaar. Nowadays, Emacs uses Git instead.

See [EmacsFromGit] or [GitForEmacsDevs].
