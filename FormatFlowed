== What is flowed text? ==

##format=flowed## is defined in [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3676.html RFC3676] and enables mail clients to support the distinction between physical and logical lines, while still supporting older clients.

The message is sent wrapped (usually to the 66th column), with newlines encoded with an extra space at the end of the previous line. Graphical clients can unwrap the message back to its original form, performing word-wrapping at window's margins. Older clients can simply disregard newline information, and display the wrapped message.

The advantage of flowed text (if an entire conversation is handled with ##format=flowed##) is the improved handling of quoted text, since each quote block is usually a single logical line that gets re-wrapped by the client dynamically. Or that's the theory, at least.

== Support for flowed text in emacs ==

=== Wanderlust ===

See WlFormatFlowed.

=== Gnus ===

See GnusFormatFlowed.

=== Using emacs as the editor for an external MUA ===

This is [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2006-06/msg00101.html still] less well supported than with Gnus or Wanderlust, but there are still options, e.g.
