= Connect to servers that allow authenticating with SASL =
JosephGay had a patched version of [[ERC]] with SASL support on GitHub.  The [https://github.com/joseph-gay/erc-sasl GitHub repo] was deleted, but a copy is available from https://gitlab.com/psachin/erc-sasl (see also https://debbugs.gnu.org/29108#31)

When you've put erc-sasl in your load-path edit your [[.emacs]] with

  (require 'erc-sasl)
  (add-to-list 'erc-sasl-server-regexp-list "host\\.server\\.com") ;; e.g. irc\\.freenode\\.net, or .* for any host

You'll need to initially pass a password to Erc for authentication.

Update: There is also a small modification to the function erc-login required for erc-sasl to work. This is the reason for cloning the entire ERC repo. Pending a few modifications, I hope to have this merged.
