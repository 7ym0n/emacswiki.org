Getting stuck?  Trying to figure something out?

== Built-in Help ==

* Use the Emacs help commands to find out more about what's going on.  If you are not familiar with them, use '''`##C-h C-h##`''' now, to learn.  


== Get Un-stuck ==

* Use '''`C-g'''' to cancel whatever command you're in. 
Use more than one `C-g', if necessary, to quit some operations.  An alternative is `ESC ESC ESC'.
* Use '''`##C-]##'''' (`abort-recursive-edit') like a super-`C-g', and command '''`top-level'''' as well.
* In many uneditable buffers, such as ##* help## buffers, '''`q'''' often quits that buffer/window.
* HelpMenuBarPlus can help. It has a '''[[HelpMenuBarPlus#Whoops|Whoops!?]]''' submenu of menu '''Help''', just for when you're stuck.

== Check your configuration ==

* If starting Emacs with '''##emacs -q##''' fixes the problem then the problem is probably due to something in your configuration. Check your InitFile.
* If ##emacs -q## has problems but '''##emacs -Q##''' doesn't, it might be related to your Emacs distribution or your local setup.


== Search for help ==

* Search this wiki and other Emacs sites for tips, links, and recommendations.

== Ask for help ==

* Remember that Emacs has many options, and the defaults might not be what you expect.  
* You might get better help if you describe what you want and politely ask for suggestions instead of saying that Emacs is broken.

=== Where to ask for help ===

You can post questions:

* In the appropriate EmacsMailingLists or EmacsNewsgroups.
* On [[EmacsStackExchange|relevant Stack Exchange sites]]. Please:
** Pose specific, concrete questions.
** Accept correct answers, to recognize people's help and make it easy for other people to find the most helpful answers.

* On Reddit's [https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs /r/Emacs] and [https://old.reddit.com/r/orgmode /r/Orgmode] subreddits. These are more discussion-oriented than are question-and-answer sites such as Stack Exchange.
* On the EmacsChannel. If you need to share your config, use a service such as Gist or Pastebin.
* With ''pay'' services such as https://www.codementor.io/emacs-experts/


== Feeling frustrated? ==

Relax, and EnjoyWrestlingWithEmacs, knowing that others have gone through it and survived. ;-)
