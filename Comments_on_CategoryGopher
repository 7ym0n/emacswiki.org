To Alex Schr√∂der: No harm meant in ripping your text apart and replacing it, but it wasn't exactly good, and wrong or at least misleading in many places.  By the way, I think it is not really good style to recommend a thing because you've written it; let other people decide about recommendations.

I thought it was good and not misleading at all. I recommend Elpher and I didn't write it.
