Get it here:

* [https://github.com/kensanata/elisp/blob/master/pink-bliss-theme.el pink-bliss-theme.el] from GitHub

This version uses Emacs' own Custom code.

There's also an older version that changes the menu bar to show a gnu head, as you can see in the screenshot:

* Lisp:pink-bliss.el from Emacs Wiki, 
* [[pink-gnu.xpm]] (image required for the tool-bar based on [http://www.gnu.org/graphics/heckert_gnu.html Heckertâ€™s bold gnu head])

You need to install the _image_!
The theme switches on the toolbar, removes all the icons, adds a gnu, and binds
a very simple defun to the button:
If the current buffer is modified, a click will save the buffer.
If the current buffer has been saved, a click will open a new file.

: Gha ! :) Really nice :)

I just heard that the Hello Kitty! color theme was implemented and after having seen it I think it is just as I had imagined it (though I think the region hilight would look better if it was pure white).

My next challenge is a color theme called Eye Cancer. :)
