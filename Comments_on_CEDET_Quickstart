This page is a train wreck.  For a reasonable quickstart page, it should have just one block of configuration, not three.

The second example does not make sense on this Wiki since the CEDET's include with most emacs distributions and The standalone CEDETs are divergent.  For example, the second config setup shows (semantic-load-enabl-code-helpers) which will not work with the CEDET package in emacs.  Instead, you must use the standalone version which this page *DOES NOT MENTION*.
