If you're not quite keen on getting into EmacsLisp yet, check out
CategoryCustomize for ways you can configure Emacs without writing Lisp
code. In fact, do that even if you ''are'' keen on using EmacsLisp. ;-)

If you're open to [[LearnEmacsLisp|learning a little Emacs Lisp]],
there's a lot you can do! Click on the page title above to list all
pages related to writing your own InitFile. Here is a categorized list
of selected resources.
