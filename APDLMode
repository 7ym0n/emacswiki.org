The GNU-Emacs major mode for the programming language APDL

You can install APDL-Mode from [https://melpa.org Melpa] and you'll
find the code on its [https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/apdl-mode Github page].

APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language) is the solver scripting
language of the mechanical FEA (Finite Element Analysis) suite
[https://www.ansys.com ANSYS] (ANalysis SYStem, registered TM).

APDL-Mode (formerly ANSYS-Mode) represents, in conjunction with the
GNU-Emacs editor, an advanced APDL environment with features like
solver communication (GNU-Linux only), license reporting, keyword
completion, code templates, dedicated keybindings, etc.  Over the
years it has accumulated lots of features for writing and debugging
complete FEA models in APDL code. Please convince yourself with the
APDL-Mode in-depth documentation.

With the advent of the modern ANSYS GUIs - like `WorkBench' or
`AIM' - the usage of APDL as a wholesale modelling language has
diminished.  But APDL is here to stay: `WorkBench' and `Discovery AIM' operate
exclusively the ANSYS solver with it!  They are sending APDL input
(.dat) files to the solver.  For a true understanding of the GUIs'
inner workings a study of their APDL code is prerequisite.

On the other hand the GUIs are not supporting all solver features.
So APDL `Command Snippets' enhance the GUIs' modeling capabilities.
