[[es:SuperCiteEs]]
Supercite is an official GNU Emacs package written entirely in Emacs
Lisp. It interfaces to most of the commonly used Emacs mail user agents
(MUAs) and news user agents (NUAs), and provides
sophisticated facilities for the citing and attributing of message
replies.  Supercite has a very specific and limited role in the process
of composing replies to both USENET network news and electronic mail.


The preferred way to spell Supercite is with a capital S,
lowercase the rest, but for the sake of this camel-wiki system, here is
known as SuperCite.


Supercite is only useful in conjunction with MUAs and NUAs such as VM,
GNUS, RMAIL, etc. (hereafter referred to collectively as MUAs).
Supercite is typically called by the MUA after a reply buffer has been
setup.  Thereafter, Supercite's many commands and formatting styles are
available in that reply buffer until the reply is sent.  Supercite is
re-initialized in each new reply buffer.

As said in [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/sc/Getting-Connected.html (sc) Getting Connected]:

: In most cases, all that is necessary to begin using Supercite is to add
the following to ‘~.emacs’:

     (add-hook 'mail-citation-hook 'sc-cite-original)

The manual should come with Emacs, ##<f1> i m SC RET##, and online at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/sc/index.html.
