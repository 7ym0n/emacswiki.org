This mode does what [[Tumme]] used to do: it inserts a thumbnail for every image in the directory
into a special buffer linked to the ##dired## buffer such that moving from one thumbnail to the next
selects the appropriate file in the linked ##dired## buffer.

Use ##M-x image-dired## to do this.

To increase the margin around images so you can better see which file is currently selected:

{{{
(setq image-dired-thumb-margin 5)
}}}

Alternatively, mark some files, e.g. using ##m % jpg$ RET## and use ##C-t C-t## to run ##image-dired-dired-toggle-marked-thumbs##.
This inserts thumbnails into the dired buffer!
