In one's opinion, this answer is in bad form. 
ALL automatic indentations should be simple to toggle from a single place.
In many cases the automatic indents are inappropriate, inconvenient productivity killers.
However much effort went into coding the "indent engines" does not make them more useful to anyone other than the author of the engines, in most cases. "Ram-rodding" such immature features down the throats of users is just in poor taste.

LaTeX mode indenting is just awful. I'm writing text, not code! This wiki-page should be helpful, but alas it is not. A function is given, but how/where do I put it?  How do I customize a variable? The in-editor `Preview' is killer, but I'm wasting time trying to get the indentation right, which is exactly antithetical to the point of LaTeX.
