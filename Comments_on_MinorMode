To anonymous 68.108.108.58: It makes no sense to use this kind of thing more than once on a page: ##'''[::minor mode]s'''##.

How do I ensure that a mode is always active/enabled? For example, I'd like electric-pair-mode to always be on.

From the manual: "Some minor modes are global: while enabled, they affect everything
you do in the Emacs session, in all buffers.  Other minor modes are
buffer-local; they apply only to the current buffer, so you can enable
the mode in certain buffers and not others."

Some modes offer both, ##some-mode## and ##global-some-mode##. If the minor mode you are interested in does not offer that, you could still add it to a hook. One very generic hook would be ##find-file-hook##, for example.
