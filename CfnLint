The command line tool <tt>cfn-lint</tt> is a linter for CloudFormation templates, used to describe infrastructure components in Amazon Web Services (AWS).

You can read more about the tool and how to install it here: https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint

I've integrated <tt>cfn-lint</tt> with Emacs using yaml-mode and flycheck, see <tt>[[cfn-mode.el]]</tt>
