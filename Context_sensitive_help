Context sensitive help is help that matches the major mode you're using and the symbol you're looking at.

== Emacs Lisp ==

Emacs has two key bindings programmers are very familiar with:

* `C-h f' gives you the documentation for the function at point
* `C-h v' gives you the documentation for the variable at point

== Perl ==

CPerl mode comes with the function `cperl-perldoc' that calls `perldoc' on the symbol at point.
Here's a simple addition to your config file to make `C-h f' call it, even if you use ordinary
Perl mode instead of CPerl mode.

{{{
(add-hook 'perl-mode-hook 'my-context-help-for-perl-mode)

(defun my-context-help-for-perl-mode ()
  (require 'cperl-mode);; for help
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-h f") 'cperl-perldoc))
}}}

== Python ==

Python mode has support for EldocMode, and a key binding to go along with it: `C-c f`.
If that doesn't do what you expect it to do, give the following code a try.

{{{
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (local-set-key (kbd "C-h f") 'pydoc-at-point)))

(defun pydoc-at-point ()
  "Run `pydoc' on the word around point."
  (interactive)
  (pydoc (python-eldoc--get-symbol-at-point)))

(defun pydoc (word)
  "Run `pydoc' on WORD."
  (interactive
   (list (let* ((default-entry (python-eldoc--get-symbol-at-point))
                (input (read-string
                        (format "pydoc entry%s: "
                                (if (string= default-entry "")
                                    ""
                                  (format " (default %s)" default-entry))))))
           (if (string= input "")
               (if (string= default-entry "")
                   (error "No pydoc args given")
                 default-entry)
             input))))
  (require 'man)
  (let* ((case-fold-search nil)
	 (Man-switches nil)
	 (manual-program "pydoc"))
    (Man-getpage-in-background word)))
}}}
