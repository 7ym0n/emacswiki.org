Context sensitive help is help that matches the major mode you're using and the symbol you're looking at.

== Emacs Lisp ==

Emacs has two key bindings programmers are very familiar with:

* `C-h f' gives you the documentation for the function at point
* `C-h v' gives you the documentation for the variable at point

== Perl ==

CPerl comes with the function `cperl-perldoc' that calls `perldoc' on the symbol at point.
Here's a simple addition to your config file to make `C-h f' call it, even if you use ordinary
Perl mode instead of CPerl.

{{{
(add-hook 'perl-mode-hook 'my-context-help-for-perl-mode)

(defun my-context-help-for-perl-mode ()
  (require 'cperl-mode);; for help
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-h f") 'cperl-perldoc))
}}}
