a.k.a casouri.

I started using Emacs in 2017 when I was a freshman in college. I've been playing with it ever since.
Emacs had opened a new world to me: Lisp, AI, Lisp machine, ancient languages, PLT, etc. 
I wouldn't find so many amazing things and find my interest in PLT and decide to go in this direction
once I graduate if I haven't met Emacs.
I think this is an interesting view on what Emacs can do beyond the pragmatic aspect.

You can find me on [https://emacs-china.org emacs-china] under the name casouri, or visit [https://archive.casouri.co.uk/note my blog]. I put all the packages I wrote on [https://www.github.com/casouri github].
