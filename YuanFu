== Me ==

a.k.a casouri.

I started using Emacs in 2017 when I was a freshman in college. I've been playing with it ever since.

You can find me on [https://emacs-china.org emacs-china] under the name casouri, or visit [https://archive.casouri.cat/note my blog]. I put all the packages I wrote on [https://www.github.com/casouri github].

Emacs Makes A Computer Slow

== Development ==

Here are some of the packages that I wrote.
