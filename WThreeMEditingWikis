== Editing wiki pages ==

The latest version of WikiRemote includes the function
`wiki-remote-get-w3m'.  Call it to edit the wiki page you are
currently visiting.  Here's an example which allows you to hit `e' to
edit the page you are currently browsing.

 (autoload 'wiki-remote-get-w3m "wiki-remote"
   "Edit wiki pages currently visited using w3m." t)

 (add-hook 'w3m-mode-hook
	   (lambda ()
	     (define-key w3m-mode-map "e" 
	       (lambda ()
		 (interactive)
		 (condition-case nil
		     (wiki-remote-get-w3m)
		   (error (w3m-edit-current-url)))))))

Be sure to look at the customizations of WThreeM for the
w3m-form-input-textarea-mode-hook.

== Jumping to Wiki-like Pages ==

I defined this little defun for quickly going to specific pages of a
Wiki.  It's kindof like the Interwiki Names.

<pre>
 (defvar dka-w3m-wikis
  '(("lathi" "http://www.lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/" "WebHome")
    ("emacs"  "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?" "RecentChanges")
    ("google" "http://www.google.com/search?q=" "")
    ("debian" "http://wiki.debian.net/" "")))

 (defun dka-w3m-goto-wiki ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((wiki-topic (read-input "Wiki:Topic? "))
        topic wiki wiki-list)
    (message wiki-topic)
    (if (string-match "\\(.*\\):\\(.*\\)" wiki-topic)
        (setq wiki (match-string 1 wiki-topic) 
              topic (match-string 2 wiki-topic)
              wiki-list (assoc wiki dka-w3m-wikis))
      (error "Must specify a wiki name and topic (Wiki:TopicName)"))
    (unless wiki-list
      (error (format "\"%s\" is not a defined wiki" wiki)))
    (unless topic
      (setq topic (nth 2 wiki-list)))
    (w3m-goto-url (concat (nth 1 wiki-list) topic))))
</pre>

== Editing CGI::Kwiki Pages ==

CGI::Kwiki (http://kwiki.org/) pages can be edited simply with WThreeM's form support and some help from LongLines mode and RefillMode.  A few customizations are in order:

    (setq w3m-form-input-textarea-buffer-lines 50
          w3m-form-input-textarea-mode-hook
          '(longlines-mode
            (lambda () (save-excursion
                         (goto-char (point-min))
                         (while (search-forward (string 13) nil t)
                           (replace-match "" nil t))))
            flyspell-mode
            refill-mode)
          w3m-form-input-textarea-set-hook '(longlines-mode))

== Use Oddmuse mode instead ==

Not a lot of people use w3m in Emacs to edit this Wiki, EmacsWiki.  More often people use OddmuseMode in Emacs to browse and edit pages.

[new]
Are there people who happily use emacs-w3m for editing pages on EmacsWiki? -- AaronHawley

[new]
There are people who tried getting past the captcha many times and gave up editing emacswiki because emacs-w3m simply does not work for it.  This is the first I heard of oddmusemode.  There are also people who have caching problems where recent changes does not show edits made in another browser.  --

[new]
Yeah, the reCaptcha extension was added on [[2008-09-05]].  That's a bummer it doesn't work for w3m visitors.

Perhaps the solution is making a hook in w3m that edits pages on Emacs Wiki in Oddmuse mode?  That'd be cool.  Again, Oddmuse mode can handle browsing *and* editing of pages.  I can understand if one prefers the interaction and keyboard commands the know and prefer in w3m.  -- AaronHawley

Don't forget to enable the use of cookies!

Next, [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/uihnscuskc/SiteMap follow this

being triggered.

=== Editing other wikis is still a problem ===
There is such a problem with captcha at other wikis: for example, [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellWiki_talk:Community#captcha_not_visible_in_.28emacs-.29w3m_:.28 the problem described at the Haskell Wiki]. Can a solution be suggested for emacs-w3m for overcoming the captcha barrier?

==Searching emacswiki.org==
Put this in your .emacs file:

   (require 'w3m-search)
   (add-to-list 'w3m-search-engine-alist
		'("emacs-wiki" "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?search=%s"))
