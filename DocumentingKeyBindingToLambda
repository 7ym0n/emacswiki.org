*Skip* this article if you do *not* care about key-binding descriptions.

Here is the *problem*: if you simply bind a key to a lambda with `define-key' like this ...

<pre>
(define-key global-map [pause] 
  '(lambda () "say foo" (interactive) (message "foo")))
</pre>

... then the key will be reported by `describe-bindings' like this ...

<pre>
<pause>         ??
</pre>

A *solution* is to give the lambda a name describing its function.
This *wrapper* can be used to turn the documentation string into a name ...

<pre>
(defun lambda-key (keymap key def)
  "Wrap`define-key' to provide documentation."
  (set 'sym (make-symbol (documentation def)))
  (fset sym def)
  (define-key keymap key sym))
</pre>

Then after ...

<pre>
(lambda-key global-map [pause] 
  '(lambda () "say foo" (interactive) (message "foo")))
</pre>

... the key binding will be described like this:

<pre>
<pause>         say foo
</pre>

Since `lambda-key' has the same signature as `define-key',  
you can quickly switch between them.  (Tested with Emacs 25.2)
