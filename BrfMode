= Brf Mode =

Brf Mode is not a strict emulation of the old DOS editor `Brief', but
rather provides an *accurate* implementation of specific features that I miss
from `Brief'. So in other words, rather than turning Emacs into Brief, it adds some `Brief' features to Emacs: 

* Line-mode cut and paste.
* Column-mode cut and paste.
* Fully reversible paging and scrolling.
* Temporary bookmarks.
* Cursor motion undo.
* Easy window management.

However they have been implemented in an Emacs-style. This means the functions respond to prefix args and where they override Emacs functions, they live on the Emacs key bindings as well as the original Brief keys.

Moreover, functionality has been extended to those parts of Emacs that were never part of Brief. For example, text cut/copied in line or column-mode can be saved/recalled in registers.

Also some functionality was never part of Brief nor Emacs (for example `List Bookmarks' and the mode uses the prefix `C-c C-b' for such commands.

Installing the `brf' package from MELPA is the easiest way.
