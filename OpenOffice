People have petitioned that Emacs key bindings be imported.  Note that in 2010 OpenOffice was forked into [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice LibreOffice], which, by 2015, sustained enormously larger developer activity than OpenOffice.  See [https://lwn.net/Articles/637735/ Development activity in LibreOffice and OpenOffice {LWN.net}].  In 2016, according to Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_OpenOffice Apache OpenOffice - Wikipedia]), OpenOffice's project management committee chair Dennis Hamilton began a discussion of possibly discontinuing the project, after the Apache board had put them on monthly reporting due to the project's ongoing problems handling security issues.

OpenOffice stores data in [[OpenDocument]] format, which you can partially view and edit in Emacs too.
