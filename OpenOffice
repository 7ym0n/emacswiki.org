[http://openoffice.org/ Apache OpenOffice] is a FreeSoftware office suite available for many platforms.  Writer, the word processor of OpenOffice, is nothing like Emacs.  People have petitioned that Emacs key bindings be imported.  Note that in 2010 OpenOffice was forked into [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice LibreOffice], which, by 2015, sustained enormously larger developer activity than OpenOffice.  See [https://lwn.net/Articles/637735/ Development activity in LibreOffice and OpenOffice {LWN.net}].  In 2016, according to Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_OpenOffice Apache OpenOffice - Wikipedia]), OpenOffice's project management committee chair Dennis Hamilton began a discussion of possibly discontinuing the project, after the Apache board had put them on monthly reporting due to the project's ongoing problems handling security issues.  There have been continual problems providing timely fixes to security vulnerabilities since 2015.  Major GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian and Fedora have long since replaced OpenOffice with LibreOffice -- Debian in version Wheezy (released in May 2013) and Fedora in version 15 (released in May 2011).

OpenOffice stores data in [[OpenDocument]] format, which you can partially view and edit in Emacs too.
