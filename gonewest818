aka Neil Okamoto

=== Intro ===

I was first introduced to Emacs in 1987 in the "Fishbowl" which was one of the ProjectAthena clusters for student use at MIT. In those days, Athena ran on DEC Vaxstations and IBM RT PCs. GNUS had just been released. We used [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(protocol) Zephyr] for instant messaging between students, and for asking TAs for help. 

Most of my career has been spent in technology for the animation and visual effects industry.
