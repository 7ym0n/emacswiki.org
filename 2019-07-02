Hey Alex,

I've tried to file a report about updating the Interwiki entry in the MediaWiki software for this wiki.  It's still pointing to the ##wiki.pl## script, see https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T227053.  

I assume I'm doing the right thing, but let me know if you have better ideas.  

Thanks! -- AaronHawley

Sounds good to me! I do try to keep the old URLs working, though. If I get a report of old URLs no longer working I'll do my best to Apache mod_rewrite it all until it works. :)

Also, good to see you, Aaron. :)
