Hey Alex,

I've tried to file a report about updating the Interwiki entry in the MediaWiki software for this wiki.  It's still pointing to the ##wiki.pl## script, see https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T227053.  

I assume I'm doing the right thing, but let me know if you have better ideas.  

Thanks! -- AaronHawley

Sounds good to me! I do try to keep the old URLs working, though. If I get a report of old URLs no longer working I'll do my best to Apache mod_rewrite it all until it works.

Also, good to see you, Aaron. :)

Thanks, Alex.  I was surprised and impressed the old URLs were working. -- AaronHawley

The change was merged and will be released in Media Wiki 1.35 next month.  The change is actually already deployed on the Wikipedia family of web sites as part of their release process. I tested it out and it seems to work. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.35/wmf.23    -- AaronHawley
