Am I missing something, or does this page not mention how to setup dired+ for use?

Perhaps the default diredp-compressed-extensions today should also have "xz" and "lzma"?

@[[xuhdev]]: I don't see why, a priori.  But if you provide (good) reasons then I'll consider them. (You can of course customize the value.) Here are lists of possible compressed-file extensions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats.

@[[DrewAdams]] because the xz format is pretty ubiquitous now. Quoted from [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils Wikipedia XZ utils]]:

{{A number of Linux distributions, including Fedora, Slackware, Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch Linux,[4] use xz for compressing their software packages. The GNU FTP archive also uses xz.}}

Even Linux has switched their public download format to xz (check out the download link on [[https://www.kernel.org/ their web page]]) At least, I think, xz should be added as it is quite common now.

Is there a way to remove a line from a Dired+ buffer, the way C-x D A adds files to a Dired+ buffer?
