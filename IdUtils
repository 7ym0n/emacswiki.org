The GNU ID utilities maintains a database of identifiers in your source
code, similar to EmacsTags but it works with binary files rather than text source files.  The package comes with a simple interface for Emacs.

ElScreen-GF (in conjunction with EmacsLispScreen) is an yet another
interface to GNU ID utilities.

CEDET (CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools) has support for using ID Utils as a back end for several tasks.
Those tasks include:
* EDE locate - Helps EDE file include files, or jump to a file.
* SemanticBovinator - The Symref tool in semantic uses IDUtils to find symbols usages.
