Everyone has their own dreams, and every emacser  has an own operating system dream!   -- AndyStewart

==We want full-featured browser in Emacs!==
I think all emacsers are hoping to run a modern browser  inside Emacs, instead of plain text browser like w3m, as it breaks emacs' pure text world. 
We hope to run a WebKit engine browser the way other modern application do. Beside text content, it can run javascript, can access any modern website you want, 
and most importantly, it can be integrated with Emacs well.

Following is a screenshot of emacs-webkit, part of [https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-emacs DeepinEmacs] project:

==How it works?==
Following picture shows the design of emacs-webkit:

==How to install it?==
Emacs-webkit is based on [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro PyQt5]/[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-xlib PythonXlib]/[https://github.com/tkf/python-epc PythonEPC] , so you need to install all these libraries to run emacs-webkit.

Then download the emacs-webkit source code from [https://github.com/martyr-deepin/emacs-webkit github] and put webkit.el in your load-path.

After loading it, enjoy your browsing with M-x webkit-open-url.

==Hacking the powerful browser!==
I spend almost all my time on [http://www.linuxdeepin.com LinuxDeepin] operating system, which leave me not so much time in the elisp world.

It's a my pleasure to have you [https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-emacs/tree/master/site-lisp/extensions/webkit JoinUs] to build the most powerful browser for Emacs hackers!

==WebKit with other extension==
Below is screenshot of WebKit with my extension [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ChmView ChmView] that browse CHM file in WebKit browser:
