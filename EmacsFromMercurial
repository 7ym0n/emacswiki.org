Emacs uses Git as its version control system since 2014-11-12. This page is therefore out of date and of mainly historical interest.

A [[Mercurial]] mirror of the [EmacsFromBazaar Emacs Bazaar repository] is available.

 hg clone http://hg.intevation.org/mirrors/gnu.org/emacs-trunk

[NicFerrier I] built another one on bitbucket:

 hg clone https://nic@bitbucket.org/nic/emacs 

which seems to be no longer maintained.
