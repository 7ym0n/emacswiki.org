= PHPs - Another Semantic Major-Mode for PHP in Emacs =

Goal: An Emacs major mode for PHP scripting language which aims at making a full semantic integration. Currently at /usable/ stage.

This mode does not require PHP installed on your computer because it has a built-in elisp based semantic lexer. It supports all PHP versions and Emacs >= 26.
