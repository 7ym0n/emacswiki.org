"There are two major modes for editing Scala programs"

What are they? This is not made clear anywhere.  There then follows one bullet point. Is that one of them?

And later, we hear "there is also.." ok. is that one of the two, or a third?

Then there follows an obsolete example.  

I was looking for information, but I received none here, I'm afraid. These comments are not meant to be mean, but to provide feedback on the usefulness of this page.
