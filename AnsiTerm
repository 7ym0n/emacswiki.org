[[ja:AnsiTerm-ja]]
This is a terminal emulator written in EmacsLisp.
Now you can run vi (or mutt! (see MuttInEmacs) (or Emacs! :))) in an Emacs buffer!

Start ansi-term with `M-x ansi-term'.

Historically, `M-x ansi-term' differed from `M-x term' in that the latter couldn't render colours. These days ([https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2007-12/msg00199.html ref]) the latter has caught up, so the main practical difference is now that ansi-term uses `C-x' for a prefix key, while term sticks with only the older `C-c' binding. They also use slightly different buffer names.

`ansi-term' also does not support ncurses while `term' does.

In Emacs 22, try prefixing actions that aren't recognized by their standard key commands with `C-x'. For example, `M-x' becomes `C-x M-x'.

NB: While ansi-term and term are closely related to each other, they shouldn't be confused with the entirely separate `M-x terminal-emulator' package. This is expected to be announced as obsolete in the [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS?id=55d5b3e35ac0de26fb09525e64d528db218f04e0#n909 NEWS] file for Emacs 24.4.
